j4sign - an open, multi-platform digital signature solution

From inside the root of your j4sign binary distribution,
run (with administration rights) first the install.bat 
(or install.sh in unix environments) script for installing 
the java extension and the related native libraries.

In order to do full verification of signatures, you have
to download the signed package of root CA certificates from:

http://www.cnipa.gov.it/site/_files/lista%20dei%20certificati.html

and place it inside the "conf" directory along with "DigitPA.cer", 
the root certificate for the signing certificate of the package.
Then modify accordingly the package name in the conf.properties file.
